# Carnation

Merriam-Webster defines carnation as:
> : a plant of any of numerous often cultivated and usually double-flowered varieties or subspecies of an Old World pink (Dianthus caryophyllus) found in many color variations

We define carnation as the best tool for managing the Visual Studio editor's syntax highlighting colors.

## How to Use

### Classification Grid

The classification grid will list all configurable classifications for the editor. From the grid you are able to click on the Foreground and Background colors to customize to your liking.

### Searching Classifications

Since the list of classifications can be large and hard to navigate, we have included a searchbox which will allow you to quickly navigate to the classifications you want to customize.

### Following the Cursor

If you do not know the name for a classification you want to update, don't worry. We have a "Follow Cursor" option which will show you the classification at your cursor as well as all the classifications within your editor's selection.

## Themes

### Included Themes

Carnation ships with a number of popular included themes. You can find these with the "Themes" button. These are themes from [StudioStyle](StudioStyl.es) that we enjoy. 

### Import/Export Themes

If you want to do more with themes, Carnation also support importing and exporting them. You can find a lot more on [StudioStyle](StudioStyl.es) or create your own! Once you've tuned everything to your liking, simply use `Themes > Export` to save. 

### Reset

If you want to go back to the Visual Studio defaults, use the `Themes > Reset` button to undo all changes. This is great if you were, like us, trying random features and forgot what all you changed. Sometimes you just need to start over! 

## Accessibility Features

### Contrast

Carnation wants to help you make your code easy to read by making the contrast ratio of your color choices visible at all times. In the Classification Grid you will see the contrast ratio as well as whether the contrast meets WCAG 2.0 requirements.

### Suggestions

Suggestions are here to help mass apply suggested colors to improve contrast ratios. This is similar to applying in the Classification Grid, but applies all suggestions instead of a single. Use the menu at the top titled "Suggestions" to get started. 

## How to Remove

Uninstall the extension in VS
